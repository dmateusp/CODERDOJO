# CODERDOJO

This is a repository containing educational activities running as Jupyter Notebooks and written in Python.
These resources were made initially by (and for) Institute of Technology's CoderDojo running thanks to members of the Computer Science Society Institute of Technology Tallaght (students).

You can learn about CoderDojo here www.coderdojo.org

## How to run an activity?

TODO: Update description!

## Can I use this?

Feel free to use these resources in any context (or contribute!), one of the projects is to make these activities available in many languages!.
