# CODERDOJO

This is a repository containing educational activities running as Jupyter Notebooks and written in Python.
These resources were made initially by (and for) Institute of Technology's CoderDojo running thanks to members of the Computer Science Society Institute of Technology Tallaght (students).

You can learn about CoderDojo here www.coderdojo.org

## How to run an activity?

### For mentors / ninjas
1. Download the activities / solutions here https://github.com/dmateusp/CODERDOJO/archive/master.zip
2. Unzip the downloaded file to any folder, we will name it CoderDojoActivities as an example
3. Go to the folder CoderDojoActivities and unzip `devenv.zip` at the root of the folder (virtual environment containing the python libraries)
4. Launch the virtual environment by typing `.\devenv\Scripts\activate` in a command line (Windows) at the root of CoderDojoActivities, Mac and Linux will probably use `./devenv/Scripts/activate`
5. Launch the Jupyter activities by typing `jupyter notebook` in the console where the virtual environment is activated (same console), this will open a website
6. On the website, navigate to /activities and chose an activity! you can also go to /solutions to see the solutions to each activity.

## Can I use this?

Feel free to use these resources in any context (or contribute!), one of the projects is to make these activities available in many languages!.

## Feedback

If you have ideas to improve activities or create new ones, feel free to create a new issue on the repository or/and contribute yourself :)
